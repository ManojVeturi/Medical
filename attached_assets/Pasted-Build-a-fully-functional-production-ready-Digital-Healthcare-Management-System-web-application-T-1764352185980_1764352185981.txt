Build a fully functional, production-ready “Digital Healthcare Management System” web application.
The goal is to improve doctor-patient communication, track treatment progress efficiently, and organize all health-related information clearly and securely.

🔧 1. Technical Requirements
Frontend

Use React or Next.js (preferred), fully responsive.

Clean, modern medical UI/UX design.

Pages/screens required:

Patient Dashboard

Doctor Dashboard

Appointment Scheduling

Treatment Progress Timeline

Medical Records Viewer

Messaging/Consultation Chat

Login & Registration (patients + doctors)

Profile Management

Notifications Center

Include charts for health metrics (use Chart.js or similar).

Backend

Use Node.js + Express or Next.js API routes, OR Python Django/FastAPI (developer’s choice).

Include the following modules:

User Authentication (JWT or OAuth)

Role Management (Doctor / Patient)

Patient Health Record Management

Appointment System with availability logic

Secure Messaging System

Treatment Progress Tracking

Audit logs

API should be fully documented.

Database

Use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

Required tables/collections:

users

medical_records

appointments

messages

treatment_plans

notifications

Security & Privacy

Full HIPAA-style data handling practices.

Encrypted passwords.

Secure API routes.

Role-based access (patients can’t see doctor data and vice versa).

🚀 2. Deployment Requirements

Deploy the complete working site on Vercel, Netlify, or Render (or any automatic deployment platform).

Set up the database on MongoDB Atlas or equivalent.

After deployment, provide the public URL for the working website.

Also provide a GitHub repository link containing all source code (frontend + backend).

📦 3. Deliverables

The final answer must include:

Live Website Link (public URL)

GitHub Repo Link

Installation & run instructions

List of all features implemented

API documentation

Admin login test credentials

Patient login test credentials

🎯 4. Purpose of the System

The application should:

Help doctors track patient progress clearly.

Keep treatment updates organized and accessible.

Provide a simple, secure space for patients to follow their care journey.

Improve clarity, reduce missed updates, and streamline doctor-patient communication.

End of prompt. Generate the complete, finished project and deploy it.

If you'd like, I can also generate:
✅ A shorter version of the prompt
✅ A specialized prompt for Replit, Vercel AI, or any specific builder
✅ A diagram or architecture outline of the system
